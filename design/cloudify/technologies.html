                            Since scientists still have no idea how clouds
                            work, we had to figure it out ourselves.  Through
                            our research we found that clouds are made of water
                            vapour and air.  Long story short, you can live in a
                            cloud if you want to.  It takes a lot of technology,
                            though, and that's really our dream.  To take a lot
                            of technology and make something really complicated
                            and <em>cool</em>.

                        <p>For example, this pie chart is really <em>cool looking</em>.</p>

                        <p>And this moose is walking.</p>

                        <p>
                            How did we make such a cool technology?  It's way too complicated
                            to explain, but it involves an MRI machine, magnets, birds,
                            cotton balls, 0s and 1s, bits, bytes, and cheese.

                            You can obviously see that the cloud is really cool, so that's
                            why we wanted to live in it.  You can live here free for
